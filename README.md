YouVote
=======

YouVote is a social media site, where users can create profiles and share pictures. Pictures will be separated into predefined categories, where users can vote on one picture per category per week and make comments on those pictures as well. Once a week, a winner in each category is featured and voting will start over again once winners are announced. The site will be implemented as a website using Java JSP and PostgreSQL.
